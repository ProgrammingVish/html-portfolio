<p>I like playing the guitar when I'm free, and also play video games to ease my mind. I'm a firm believer that
  science truimps everything and can explain almost anything that goes on, in this world we call earth. I'm 
  extremely enthusiastic about astronomy, it's complexity and the mysteries that it brings. I'm also a food 
  afficionado. I love writing short and long stories. I also do love adventurous travels.
